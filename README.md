# Battleship
I made a battleship game that can be played on the terminal. Each player inserts their coordinates they wish to put each of
the ships at. Then, each player takes turn selecting a coordinate to attack(i.e A1, E5, H3 etc.). Ultimately, when all the
ships either of the players board have been attacked fully, the game will end.
